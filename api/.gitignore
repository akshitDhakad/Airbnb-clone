# .gitignore (api folder)
node_modules/
.env
For the client folder, create another .gitignore file with content specific to the client-side code:

plaintext
Copy code
# .gitignore (client folder)
node_modules/
build/
.env
Adjust the patterns according to your project's structure and dependencies.

Commit and Push:

Commit and push your code separately for the api and client folders:

bash
Copy code
# Inside the api folder
cd api
git add .
git commit -m "Add server-side code"
git push origin master

# Go back to the root folder
cd ..

# Inside the client folder
cd client
git add .
git commit -m "Add client-side code"
git push origin master
Make sure to replace origin and master with your appropriate remote and branch names.

Create a GitHub Repository:

If you haven't created a GitHub repository yet, create one on GitHub's website.

Link Remote Repository:

Link your local Git repository to the remote GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the URL of your GitHub repository.

Push to GitHub:

Push your local repositories to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
# Inside the api folder
cd api
git push origin master

# Go back to the root folder
cd ..

# Inside the client folder
cd client
git push origin master
Now your code for both the server-side (api) and client-side (client) will be uploaded to separate folders within your GitHub repository.

By maintaining separate .gitignore files for the api and client folders, you ensure that each side of your MERN stack project's dependencies and build artifacts are ignored as needed.
